# Gentium Plus WSP [![Build Status](http://build.palaso.org/app/rest/builds/buildType:Fonts_GentiumWspx/statusIcon)](http://build.palaso.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Fonts_GentiumWspx&guest=1) 

This is a custom font project for WSP based on [Gentium Plus - Regular](http://software.sil.org/gentium). It adds a variety of symbols, including many superscript and subscript letters and numerals. These are encoded in the Unicode Private Use Area (U+E000..U+E612). Details of added symbols and their encoding are in three files in the `documentation` folder:

- *WSPExtensions.xlsx* - Spreadsheet with a line for each added symbol and examples of potential contexts
- *WSPExtensions.pdf* - PDF version
- *WSPCharTable.xlsx* - Alternate spreadsheet showing the organization of the added symbols

Some of these additions will be integrated into a future version of the main Gentium project. Others are unique to this WSP variant.

***Note that this is a special custom variant of Gentium Plus and is not a good source on which to base derivative fonts. Please base derivatives on the [original Gentium project](http://software.sil.org/gentium).***

The original README contents for Gentium Plus are below:

This project is intended to provide a free and open font family for all current languages and writing systems that use Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek scripts. It supports almost the complete range of Unicode characters for these scripts, including a comprehensive range of diacritics and a large set of symbols useful for linguistics and literacy work. Smart font routines automatically adjust the position of diacritics to support and optimize arbitrary base+diacritic combinations. This project uses a UFO-based design and production workflow, with all sources in open formats and a completely open-source build toolkit. 

For more information on using and developing the fonts see the full project documentation. This is available in three forms:

- *local HTML* - Download the release or source package and open the file `documentation/index.html` in a browser
- *local PDF* - Download the release or source package and open the file `documentation/pdf/index.pdf`
